## About

Corgi is an HTML and XML template language, inspired by pug (hence the name), for Go. 
Just like pug, corgi also uses code generation to generate its templates.

## Main Features

* 👀 Highly readable syntax, not just replacing placeholders
* 👪 Support for inheritance
* ➕ Mixins—functions (with parameters) that render repeated pieces of corgi
* 🗄 Import mixins from other files
* 🖇 Split large templates into multiple files
* ✨ Import any Go package and use its constants, variables, types, and functions—no need for `FuncMap`s or the like
* 🤏 Generates minified HTML (and through the use of filters also minified CSS and JS)
* 🔒 Automatically escapes HTML/XML, and in HTML mode also interpolated CSS and JS
