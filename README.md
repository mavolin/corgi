## About

Corgi is an HTML template language for Go, inspired by pug (hence the name).
Just like pug, corgi also uses code generation to generate its templates.

## Main Features

* üëÄ Highly readable syntax, not just replacing placeholders
* üë™ Support for inheritance
* ‚ûï Mixins‚Äîfunctions that render repeated pieces of corgi
* üóÑ Import mixins from other files, just like you would import Go packages
* üñá Split large templates into multiple files
* ‚ú® Import any Go package and use its constants, variables, types, and functions‚Äîno need for `FuncMap`s or the like
* ü§è Generates minified HTML (and through the use of filters also minified CSS and JS)
* üîí Automatically escapes interpolated HTML, CSS and JS

## Example

First impressions matter, so here is an example of a simple template:

```jade
import "strings"

//- These are the name and params of the function that corgi will generate.
//- Besides the params you specify here, corgi will also add an io.Writer that
//- it'll write the output to, and an error return, that returns any errors
//- it encounters when writing to the io.Writer.
//-
//- The real signature will look like this:
//- func LearnCorgi(__w io.Writer, name string, knowsPug bool, friends []string) error
func LearnCorgi(name string, knowsPug bool, friends []string)

mixin greet(name string)
  | Hello, #{name}!

html(lang="en")
  head
    title Learn Corgi
  body
    h1 Learn Corgi
    p#features.font-size--big
      +greet(name=name)

    p
      if knowsPug
        | #{name}, since you already know pug,
        | learning corgi will be even more of #strong[a breeze] for you!
        |

      
      | Head over to
      | #a(href="https://mavolin.gitbook.io/corgi")[GitBook]
      | to learn it.

    switch len(friends)
      case 0
      case 1
        p And make sure to tell #{friends[0]} about corgi too!
      case 2
        p And make sure to tell #{friends[0]} and #{friends[1]} about corgi too!
      default
        p.
          And make sure to tell
          #{strings.Join(friends[:len(friends)-1], ", ")},
          and #{friends[len(friends)-1]} about corgi too!
```

Pretty-Printed output:

```html
<!-- LearnCorgi(myWriter, "Maxi", true, []string{"Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"}) -->

<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Learn Corgi</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Learn Corgi</h1>
<p id="features" class="font-size--big">Hello, Maxi!</p>
<p>
    Maxi, since you already know pug,
    learning corgi will be even more of <strong>a breeze</strong> for you!
    Head over to <a href="https://mavolin.gitbook.io/corgi">GitBook</a> to
    learn it.
</p>
<p>And make sure to tell Huey, Dewey, and Louie about corgi too!</p>
