## About

Corgi is an HTML template language for Go, inspired by pug (hence the name).
Just like pug, corgi also uses code generation to generate its templates.

## Main Features

* üëÄ Highly readable syntax that models HTML, not just replacing placeholders
* ‚ûï Mixins‚Äîfunctions that render repeated pieces of corgi
* üåÄ Conditional classes that are actually readable
* üóÑ Import other files to use their mixins
* üñá Split large templates into multiple files
* üë™ Support for inheritance
* ‚ú® Import any Go package and use any of its types, functions and constants‚Äîno need for `FuncMap`s
* ü§è Generates compile-time minified HTML, CSS, and JS
* üîí Context-aware auto-escaping and filtering of HTML, CSS, JS, and special HTML attributes
* üõ°Ô∏è Script CSP nonce injection
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Descriptive, Rust-style errors

## Example

First impressions matter, so here is an example of a simple template:

```jade
import "strings"

// corgi has a stdlib with a handful of useful mixins
use "fmt"

// These are the name and params of the function that corgi will generate.
// Besides the params you specify here, corgi will also add an io.Writer that
// it'll write the output to, and an error return, that returns any errors
// it encounters when writing to the io.Writer.
//
// The real signature will look like this:
// func LearnCorgi(w io.Writer, name string, knowsPug bool, friends []string) error
func LearnCorgi(name string, knowsPug bool, friends []string)

mixin greet(name string) Hello, #{name}!

doctype html
html(lang="en")
  head
    title Learn Corgi
  body
    h1 Learn Corgi
    p#greeting.greeting
      // the & allows you to add additional attributes to an element
      if strings.HasPrefix(name, "M"): &.font-size--big
      +greet(name=name)

    p
      if knowsPug
        > #{name}, since you already know pug,
          learning corgi will be even more of #strong[a breeze] for you!#[ ]

      > Head over to #a(href="https://mavolin.gitbook.io/corgi")[GitBook]
        to learn it.

    p And make sure to tell #+fmt.List(val=friends) about corgi too!
```

Pretty-Printed output:

```html
<!-- LearnCorgi(myWriter, "Maxi", true, []string{"Huey", "Dewey", "Louie"}) -->

<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<head><title>Learn Corgi</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Learn Corgi</h1>
<p id=greeting class="greeting font-size--big">Hello, Maxi!</p>
<p>
    Maxi, since you already know pug,
    learning corgi will be even more of <strong>a breeze</strong> for you! Head over to
    <a href=https://mavolin.gitbook.io/corgi>GitBook</a> to learn it.
</p>
<p>And make sure to tell Huey, Dewey, and Louie about corgi too!</p>
</body>
</html>
```
